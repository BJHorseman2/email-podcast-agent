# 🎉 AOL-ONLY EMAIL-TO-PODCAST AUTOMATION

## ✅ **PERFECT! AOL for Everything**

I've created a **100% AOL-based system** that uses your AOL email for both:
- 📧 **Receiving** your newsletters

## 🔄 **Complete AOL Workflow:**

```

```

**Every morning:**
1. ✅ Agent reads your AOL inbox
2. ✅ Finds your target newsletter
3. ✅ Creates podcast script with AI
4. ✅ Generates voice with ElevenLabs
