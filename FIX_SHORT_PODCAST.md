# ðŸš¨ FIX: Your Mando Minutes Podcast is Too Short!

## The Problem
Your current output shows:
- **74 words** â†’ Should be **800-1200 words**
- **0.5 minutes** â†’ Should be **3-5 minutes**
- Content shrunk from 7632 to 475 characters

**Why?** Your current script only reads link titles, not the actual articles!

## The Solution: Link-Following Enhancement

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended First)
```bash
# Test if link-following works
python3 test_link_follow.py

# If successful, run the enhanced Mando agent
chmod +x run_enhanced_mando.sh
./run_enhanced_mando.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml html5lib

# Run enhanced Mando Minutes
python3 run_enhanced_mando.py
```

### Option 3: Update Your Current Workflow
If you have a specific script that's running (not the ones in this directory), you need to:

1. Find which script is generating the short podcasts
2. Replace its content extraction with link-following

## What the Enhanced Version Does

1. **Extracts all links** from Mando Minutes email
2. **Fetches actual article content** from Bloomberg, CoinDesk, etc.
3. **Creates rich podcast script** with real news content
4. **Generates 3-5 minute podcasts** instead of 30 seconds

## Expected Results

### Before (Current):
```
"BTC may hit $90-95k after Big Beautiful Bill: Hayes"
"Lummis' new bill to remove crypto tax under $300"
```

### After (Enhanced):
```
"Our first crypto story: Bitcoin May Drop to $90-95k Following Tax Bill Passage, Says Arthur Hayes

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin could experience a significant correction to the $90,000-$95,000 range following the passage of what he calls the 'Big Beautiful Bill.' In his latest blog post, Hayes argues that the implementation of new tax policies could trigger profit-taking among institutional investors who have accumulated Bitcoin positions throughout 2024. The proposed legislation includes provisions for..."
```

## Verify It's Working

After running, check for:
- Script files in `podcasts/` folder with "enhanced" in the name
- Word count of 800+ words
- Multiple article summaries in the script
- Podcast duration of 3+ minutes

## Troubleshooting

If links aren't being fetched:
- âœ… Check internet connection
- âœ… Some sites may block automated access (normal)
- âœ… The agent will use email content as fallback
- âœ… Check logs for which articles were successfully fetched

## Integration with Your System

The enhanced agent generates text scripts. To integrate with your existing TTS system:

1. The script will be saved as `podcasts/mando_minutes_enhanced_[timestamp].txt`
2. Feed this enhanced script to your TTS system
3. The result will be a proper 3-5 minute podcast!
