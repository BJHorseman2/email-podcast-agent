Let's dive into what's moving markets today.

MARKET SNAPSHOT

{btc_price}
{eth_price}

Bitcoin showing slight weakness while traditional markets hit all-time highs. This divergence is worth watching closely.

TOP STORY: WHALE EXODUS

The biggest news today: Early Bitcoin whales are moving $50 billion worth of BTC. This is massive. 

These are 2011-era holders who've held through multiple 80% crashes. When they move, markets listen. The last time we saw whale movements this size was in late 2021, right before the market top.

But here's the nuance: Are they selling on exchanges or moving to cold storage? The on-chain data suggests OTC deals, which means less immediate price impact but signals distribution to institutions.

STORY TWO: ETF PARADOX

Despite price weakness, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $602 million yesterday. This creates an interesting setup.

When institutional flows diverge from price action, the flows usually win. We saw this pattern in October 2023 before the rally to $45k. Smart money appears to be accumulating the dip while retail panics.

The key level to watch: If ETF inflows continue above $500 million daily while price stays flat, expect an explosive move within 5-7 days.

STORY THREE: EXTREME GREED WARNING

Traditional markets just hit extreme greed for the first time in 2025. The Fear and Greed Index at 85 hasn't been this high since November 2021.

Combined with whale selling, this is a caution flag. Not a crash signal, but definitely time to tighten risk management. History shows extreme greed can persist for weeks, but the eventual unwind is violent.

MACRO CONTEXT

The Fed remains hawkish with rate cut odds falling to just 5%. Trump's tariff letters start today, adding uncertainty. Japan's bond yields are soaring, signaling potential carry trade unwinding.

This macro backdrop suggests volatility ahead. Crypto's 0.75 correlation with stocks means any equity correction hits Bitcoin hard.

YOUR ACTION PLAN

First, respect the whale movements. Consider taking some profits above $108k.

Second, watch those ETF flows. If they stay strong, buy dips aggressively.

Third, hedge your bets. With extreme greed and macro uncertainty, some downside protection makes sense.

Key levels: Bitcoin support at $105k, resistance at $112k. Break either way likely leads to a $10k move.

FINAL THOUGHTS

We're at an inflection point. Whale selling meets institutional buying while markets flash greed warnings. This is where fortunes are made or lost.

Stay nimble, size appropriately, and remember: in volatile markets, cash is a position too.

That's your Mando Minutes. Trade wisely, and I'll see you tomorrow."""
